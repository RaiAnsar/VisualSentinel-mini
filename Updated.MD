## Key Issues to Resolve

1. Automated Website Checking - Critical issue since notifications won't work without this
2. Enhanced Screenshot Comparison - Overlay and difference highlighting
3. Storage Options - Allow users to select where screenshots are stored
4. SSL Certificate Monitoring - Improve accuracy and alerts
5. Response Time Visualization - Better graphs and data presentation
